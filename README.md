How to run the code:

-> Clone the repo or download zip.

-> Access master branch.

-> Open ipynb files in colab or anyhow you prefer.

-> *Data is a bit to large to push on github.* To access the data, follow this link "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kSBRmJBOpDWwUg_H1q2iLwl1o3VSqxlp?usp=sharing" and download it to your computer or copy the files to your google drive.

-> Make sure to change path name in the code to map to your preferred location.

-> Run notebook shell one by one.

-> Save your own pickle model after running NLP_course_project or use ours. Again, PKL file is a bit to large to push on github. To access the data, follow this link "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10TWYVD1MK0k1fuNWZAJ4KK8cJmpLTfmL?usp=sharing" and download it to your computer or copy the files to your google drive.
